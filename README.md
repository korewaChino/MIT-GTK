# MIT-GTK License

This is a joke variation of the MIT license, designed to exclude usage from KDE Plasma users, and linking in non-GTK applications.

Please do not actually use this license for anything serious.

If you really want to pick a proper good license, I recommend you just use the MIT license, or pick one from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).
